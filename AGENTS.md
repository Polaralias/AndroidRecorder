# Agent Onboarding Guide

This repository uses Markdown Concept (`.mdc`) files under `ai-specs/specs` as the source of truth for coding standards. Start every task by reading `ai-specs/specs/base-standards.mdc`; it is the canonical entrypoint and lists every other `.mdc` file you may need.

Use the agent-specific file (for example, `codex.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, or `GEMINI.md`) for any repo-specific nuances, but rely on `ai-specs/specs/base-standards.mdc` for the complete reading order and links to domain standards. The `.mdc` files themselves contain the enforceable rules.

This file uses Polaralias coding specs and the agent file already details key reference files here. For any required agent file changes, complete them from here onwards:
