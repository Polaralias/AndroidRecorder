## 1. Core Principles

- **Small tasks, one at a time**: Always work in baby steps, one at a time. Never go forward more than one step.
- **Test-Driven Development**: Start with failing tests for any new functionality (TDD), according to the task details.
- **Type Safety**: All code must be fully typed.
- **Clear Naming**: Use clear, descriptive names for all variables and functions.
- **Incremental Changes**: Prefer incremental, focused changes over large, complex modifications.
- **Question Assumptions**: Always question assumptions and inferences.
- **Pattern Detection**: Detect and highlight repeated code patterns.

## 2. Language Standards
- **English Only**: All technical artifacts must always use English, including:
    - Code (variables, functions, classes, comments, error messages, log messages)
    - Documentation (README, guides, API docs)
    - Jira tickets (titles, descriptions, comments)
    - Data schemas and database names
    - Configuration files and scripts
    - Git commit messages
    - Test names and descriptions

## 3. Specific standards

This document is the single entrypoint for all standards. When you start a task, follow the steps below to pull in the right `.mdc` files:

1. Always read this file first; all rules here always apply.
2. Add the domain-specific standards that match your work:
   - [Backend Standards](./backend-standards.mdc) — API development, database patterns, testing, security, and backend best practices.
   - [Frontend Standards](./frontend-standards.mdc) — React components, UI/UX guidelines, and frontend architecture.
   - [Android Standards](./android-standards.mdc) — Android/Kotlin development conventions.
   - [AI Tools Standards](./ai-tools-standards.mdc) — designing and implementing AI tools or automations.
   - [Documentation Standards](./documentation-standards.mdc) — technical documentation structure, formatting, and maintenance (including AI standards like this document).

If you work across multiple areas (for example, a feature with both backend and frontend changes), read and apply each relevant document.
